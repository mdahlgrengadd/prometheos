# WebLLM Tools Sample - Refactored

## Overview
This project has been refactored from a single monolithic `index.js` file (888 lines) into smaller, more manageable modules for better maintainability and organization.

## File Structure

### Original
- `index-original.js` - The original monolithic file (backup)

### Refactored Modules

#### Core Files
- `index.js` - Main application entry point and UI event binding (40 lines)
- `webllmEngine.js` - WebLLM engine management and chat functionality
- `modelConfig.js` - Model configuration and setup
- `toolHandler.js` - Tool handler class with model-specific templates
- `config.js` - Application configuration and rules
- `tools.js` - Tool definitions for function calling
- `toolImplementations.js` - Wikipedia and SPARQL tool implementations
- `uiUtils.js` - UI utilities for rendering and DOM manipulation

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Configuration is separate from business logic
- UI utilities are isolated from engine logic

### 2. **Improved Maintainability**
- Easier to locate and modify specific functionality
- Reduced risk of breaking unrelated features when making changes
- Better code organization and readability

### 3. **Enhanced Reusability**
- Individual modules can be imported and used independently
- Tool implementations can be easily extended or replaced
- Configuration can be modified without touching business logic

### 4. **Better Testing**
- Each module can be unit tested independently
- Mocking dependencies is much easier
- Test coverage can be more granular

### 5. **Development Experience**
- Faster IDE navigation and code completion
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features
- Better collaboration as developers can work on different modules

## Module Dependencies

```
index.js
├── webllmEngine.js
│   ├── modelConfig.js
│   ├── tools.js
│   ├── toolHandler.js
│   │   └── config.js
│   ├── uiUtils.js
│   └── toolImplementations.js
├── modelConfig.js
└── (DOM elements)
```

## Key Features Preserved

1. **WebLLM Integration** - All original WebLLM functionality maintained
2. **Model Support** - Full support for Qwen, Llama, Hermes, and other models
3. **Tool Calling** - Wikipedia and SPARQL tool implementations
4. **UI Functionality** - Complete chat interface with message handling
5. **Configuration** - All original configuration options preserved

## Usage

The refactored code maintains the same external API and functionality. Simply include `index.js` as the main entry point, and all modules will be loaded automatically through ES6 imports.

```html
<script type="module" src="src/index.js"></script>
```

## Future Enhancements

With this modular structure, future enhancements become much easier:

1. **Add New Tools** - Simply extend `tools.js` and `toolImplementations.js`
2. **Support New Models** - Add configurations to `modelConfig.js` and templates to `toolHandler.js`
3. **UI Improvements** - Modify `uiUtils.js` without affecting business logic
4. **Configuration Changes** - Update `config.js` independently
5. **Testing** - Add unit tests for each module

## Migration Notes

- All functionality from the original 888-line file has been preserved
- No breaking changes to the external API
- ES6 modules are used for better browser compatibility
- Original file is backed up as `index-original.js`
